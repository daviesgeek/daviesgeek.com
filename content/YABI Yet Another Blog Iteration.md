title: "YABI: Yet Another Blog Iteration"
---
[read.cv](https://read.cv/) recently [announced they were shutting down](https://read.cv/a-new-chapter), which is what has powered the front page of daviesgeek.com for a few years now. I setup [memos](https://www.usememos.com/) on a subdomain to serve as a blog of sorts, but was never quite happy with how it was setup. My blog posts weren't all that discoverable, the url slugs weren't my favorite (random ids vs generated slugs)

So here we go again â€” YABI: Yet Another Blog Iteration.

I've certainly changed platforms a lot. I started years ago on Blogspot (now [Blogger.com](https://www.blogger.com/about/)), moved to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) when static site generation was all the rage, then moved to [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I even had a very brief moment when I wrote my own SSG, but most recently moved to read.cv + memos hosted on my homelab. Reading back through some of my older posts, I'm cringing that I even posted what I did. But hey, it's motivating me to do better as I consider writing more often.

And that bring us to today: [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) + GitHub Pages + [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my editor.

Hopefully I can stick with this for at least a few years. I *really* don't want to change platforms again anytime soon, as I'd like to be writing more. Here's to stability, more frequent (and better quality) writing.
