Cool updates to Google Chrome today. More recently I have been doing cross-browser testing in Firefox. One of the features of the Firefox inspector is a nice little highlight that shows up on elements that have changing properties:

Chrome recently added this feature in the latest update (v41)

As you can see, it is a very useful tool for any web developer using Chrome's (or Firefox's) inspector. Thank you Google :)
