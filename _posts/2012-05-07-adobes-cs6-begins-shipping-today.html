  Adobe's latest release of its Creative Suite (CS) began shipping today, after announcing it on April 23th. The latest version has been updated for better performance. Specifically, the applications have been updated to take advantage of the 64 bit processing power. They have also changed the UI a bit to make it more user friendly, as well adding the ability to set custom layouts. Other features include content aware filling, as well as the announcement of two new webapps: Adobe Muse and Adobe Edge. I will do a more in depth post covering all the new features of Adobe's suite later.
