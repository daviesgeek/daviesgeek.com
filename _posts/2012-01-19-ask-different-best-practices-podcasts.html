As I have mentioned before, I am an active member of Ask Different, a Q and A site for Apple questions. Just recently, the podcast hosts recorded a podcast about the best practices for Ask Different. I would highly recommend listening to this podcast. It is a little long, but for anyone who participates in not only Ask Different, but any of the Stackexchange network sites. You can go listen to the podcast <a href="http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/01/podcast-20-ask-different-best-practices/">here.</a><div class="blogger-post-footer">Â© Matthew Davies</div>
