  </div>This morning, Apple announced an all-new 13" retina MacBook Pro. It is very similar to <a href="http://thegeektechblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/next-generation-macbook-pro-announced.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the 15" retina announced at WWDC</a>. The one downside that I see is that it isn't user-serviceable and it doesn't have an optical drive. Not that I want an optical drive, but I want to be able to put a second hard drive in the optical bay for a lot more space. As a video editor, I really need the extra space.
