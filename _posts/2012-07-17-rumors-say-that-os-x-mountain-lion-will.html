All of these articles suggest that the release date is set for next July 25th, next Wednesday. There are a couple reasons why this rumor is plausible. First of all, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5924596/apple-os-x-mountain-lion-gold-master-is-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Gold Master version was released to developers last Monday, the 9th</a>. If you don't know, the Gold Master version is the final build that is released to customers. This points to an imminent release date. Also, it has been reported that <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/07/15/apple-to-launch-os-x-mountain-lion-on-july-25th/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple retail stores are going to be updating their display models on July 24th,</a> the day before the reported release date. However, the content of the updates hasn't been confirmed. Yet <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/06/22/vacation-blackout-hints-at-late-july-release-for-os-x-mountain-lion/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another report from a third party support company that Apple has imposed a vacation blackout from the 22nd through the 29th,</a> again suggesting a release sometime within that timespan.<br>
  I am really looking forward to this release, as it is somewhat significant. I probably won't upgrade right away, as with the Lion update, but I hope to upgrade soon after the release.
