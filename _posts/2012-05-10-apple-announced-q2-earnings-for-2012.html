  </div>Apple released its <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/04/24Apple-Reports-Second-Quarter-Results.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Q2 2012 earnings</a> on April 24th. The company sold over 35 million iPhones in this last quarter, down from 37 million iPhones in Q1 of this year <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/01/24Apple-Reports-First-Quarter-Results.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(Q1 report)</a>. Apple sold over 11 million iPads, as well as more than 7 million iPods, and 4 million Macs. The sales have decreased a bit from last quarter's earnings, but Apple is certainly still growing. What do you think? What are next quarter's earnings going to look like?
