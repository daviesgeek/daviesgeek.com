In <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120209/apple-to-announce-ipad-3-first-week-in-march/">a post on All Things D</a>, John Paczkowski also confirms the event. Apple has declined to comment on the event, as it usually does. <a href="http://technorati.com/technology/article/apple-ipad-3-with-lte-and/">Several</a> <a href="http://www.pluggedin.co.uk/article/apple-ipad-3-hottest-leaks-so-far">sources</a>&nbsp;seem to indicate that the next generation iPad will include a retina display, an A6 processor, and LTE support. What do you think? Are these rumors true and reliable? Leave me a comment and let me know what you think?
