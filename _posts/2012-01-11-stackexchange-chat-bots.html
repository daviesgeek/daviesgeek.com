  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>As you probably know, I am a member of the Stackexchange Q&amp;A network. There are a couple interesting chat bots in the chat rooms. The first is Eliza. You can find her user profile&nbsp;<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/173432/eliza" target="_blank">here.</a>&nbsp;Eliza is actually an old chat bot that was ported to the Stackexchange chat room <a href="http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com/rooms/438/the-couch" target="_blank">The Couch</a>. It was one of the first chat bots programmed. She was written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. You can also find her in OS X's Terminal. If you type in 'emacs' at the prompt, then Shift + Esc, then x doctor then press Enter, you will be greeted by Eliza.<br>
  <br>
  Another interesting chat bot is <a href="http://askubuntu.com/users/19140/flackbot" target="_blank">Flackbot</a>. Unlike Eliza, Flackbot isn't a port of an existing AI. Flackbot was created as an experimental bot by <a href="http://askubuntu.com/users/5/george-edison" target="_blank">George Edison.</a>&nbsp;Flackbot is a little more knowledgable as he can draw information from Wikipedia and Twitter. Currently, Flackbot is down for maintenance, but you can normally find him in the <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1/sandbox" target="_blank">Sandbox</a> chat room.<br>

  If there are any other chat bots I don't know about, make sure you leave a comment letting me know.
