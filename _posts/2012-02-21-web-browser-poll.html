<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
  I created a survey awhile back to find out what web browsers people are using and why. It was just recently posted on the Super User blog. You can find the blog post <a href="http://blog.superuser.com/2012/02/13/a-poll-on-web-browser-shares/">here</a>. The survey is posted there, along with a link to the spreadsheet where the results are recorded.<br>
