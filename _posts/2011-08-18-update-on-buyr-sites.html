<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Here's an update on the Buyr sites. We hit a milestone mark about two weeks ago. Two of the sites were getting page one results. By now, I think we are getting page one results on more than one site. ClothingBuyr.com has now over 70,000 indexed pages with Google. We are very happy with the progress we are seeing on these sites.<br />We have had two server crashes in the last two weeks, both on a Saturday which was very bad. So, we are getting two servers. Half of the sites will be on one server and half will be on another.
