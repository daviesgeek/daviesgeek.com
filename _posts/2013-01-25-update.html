<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I apologize that I haven't written anything in a long time. I haven't forgotten, nor completely abandoned my blog. School and work have been my life for the last several months and I haven't had much time to work on anything else. I do plan on posting in the future and I'm also potentially looking to move to a .com domain at some point so that I'm hosting and running the entire blog myself.<br />Stay tuned! Hopefully I'll post a couple times this summer and I'm hoping to post a bit more over the summer.<br />Matthew
