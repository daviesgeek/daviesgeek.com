Could this mean they are releasing something?<br /><br /><br />Update 10:36 PM PST:<br />Store is still down more than an hour later...<br /><br /><br />Update 11:24 PM PST:<br /><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57474434-37/apple-store-goes-offline-greeting-goes-international/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cnet</a> and <a href="http://blogs.clarionledger.com/samrhall/2012/07/18/techtoday-apple-store-is-down/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sam R. Hill</a>&nbsp;have both posted articles suggesting a Mountain Lion release. However, according to the Mac Rumors guide, both <a href="http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Mac mini</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the iMac</a>&nbsp;are due for an upgrade anytime now. Stay tuned for more news...<br /><br />Update July 18th: False alarm! Looks like Apple was just doing routine maintenance. No Mountain Lion, nothing.<br /><br />However, I have a theory that Apple took the store down to add all the Mountain Lion stuff in the backend, so that the release will be a surprise, as the store won't go down the night before. All Apple has to do is throw a switch, and boom, Mountain Lion is released. Just a theory...and I'm sticking to it. :-)<br /><br />Just as a note, I do have bragging rights...as far as I know (unless someone sends me a link), I was the first to post about the store being down....<br /><br /><br />
