  Today is another big day! Apple<br>
  has scheduled an event for 10:00 AM PDT where the rumors are that they will release the long-awaited iPad mini. Apple decided to live stream this event, something they haven't done for awhile. Usually Apple releases the video later in the day, but there hasn't been a live stream in a couple years. That's all changed now! You can watch live video from the event here: http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2012/<br>
  <br>
  Note: you must use Safari or iOS to watch the event. Chrome for OS X doesn't work :-(
