  I just recently noticed something interesting on Google. When you search, you can turn off personal results.<br>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YU-0GMZd68s/Tw8tJ_DTC5I/AAAAAAAAAbw/uEZBkO0Brdg/s1600/Personal+Google+results.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YU-0GMZd68s/Tw8tJ_DTC5I/AAAAAAAAAbw/uEZBkO0Brdg/s1600/Personal+Google+results.jpg"></a>
  </div>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br>
  I have noticed that PHP, Javascript, and other web programming related results have started to show up on searches that aren't really related. I thought it was very interesting that Google has begun to give you personal results based on what links you have clicked on in the past. I hope you've enjoyed this little tidbit of information. Please comment and let me know what you think. Do you think it is a good idea for Google to begin serving personal results and what does this mean for the future of the company?
