  </div>Along with the new iPad, iOS 5.1 was released today. It contains several improvements for iOS 5, including battery bug fixes, and Siri support for Japanese. iOS 5.1 has been in beta for a couple months now, so it's no&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;that Apple released iOS 5.1 with the new iPad. This is a milestone update, because it is the first update that iOS users can receive "over the air". iOS 5.1 will not require a computer to install, unlike all previous updates.<br>
  <br>
  Other features of iOS 5.1 include:<br>
  <br>
  • &nbsp; Genius Mixes and playlist for subscribers of iTunes Match<br>
  • &nbsp; Optimized audio for movie playback via the iPad<br>
  • &nbsp; Podcast controls and 30-second rewind button for the iPad<br>
  • &nbsp; Updated AT&amp;T network indicator<br>
  • &nbsp; A fix for audio dropping for outgoing calls
